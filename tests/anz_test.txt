ANZ: Mk I Fusion Engine
Mk I Fusion Engine:            The Mk I Fusion Engine is a fusion-powered maneuver drive. It is a self-contained
                               100-ton unit, is self-sustaining and requires no external power source. To achieve
                               superior maneuverability, simply add more engines to your design. Maneuverability aids
                               in the ability of your ships to avoid certain types of enemy weapons, and provides
                               additional Action Points for your ships to use during civilian operations. The fusion
                               power plant in this series of engines is stable under normal operating conditions but
                               does not handle combat damage particularly well, with a tendency to detonate in a
                               spectacular explosion upon suffering grievious damage. (100 tons) 200 Improved Steel -
